Description: A short paragraph explaining the game.

Example: "Alaska Guesser is a web-based geography game that drops you into a random Google Street View location somewhere in Southcentral Alaska. Your mission is to figure out where you are and place a pin on the map to make your best guess!"

How to Play:

A pop-up will ask for a Google Maps API key. Instructions are provided in the pop-up.

Once the game loads, look around the Street View panorama for clues.

Click on the map on the right to place your guess marker.

Click "Make Guess" to see how close you were!

How to Run Locally: Explain that to run it on their own computer, another developer would need to download the index.html file and open it in a browser. They will need to generate their own Google Maps API key as prompted. -->
